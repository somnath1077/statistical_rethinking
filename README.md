This is a repository for code + notes for the course on _Statistical Rethinking_
by Richard McElreath based on his book by the same name. The lectures for 2019
can be found here:

The original code in the book and lectures is in R, but here we have ported it
to Python + PyMC3. The virtual environment used was created using the `environment.yml`
file created by the folks who ported the code to PYMC3 + Python
(check out: https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/blob/master/Rethinking).
In Anaconda, the command to create the virtual environment is:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This is work in progress as I follow the lectures and work through the book.
