    "In a generalized linear model (GLM), each outcome $Y$ of the dependent variable is assumed to be generated from a particular distribution from the _exponential family_, a large class of probability distributions that includes the normal, binomial, Poisson and gamma distributions, among others. The mean, $\\mu$, of the distribution depends on the independent variables, $X = (X_0, X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p)$, through:\n",

    "where $\\mathrm{E} ( Y \\mid X )$ is the expected value of $Y$ conditional on $X$; $X \\beta$ is a linear combination of unknown parameters $\\beta$; $g$ is the _link_ function.\n",
